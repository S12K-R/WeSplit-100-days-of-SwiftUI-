# WeSplit-100-days-of-SwiftUI-
Tip splitter application

It was done as a submission for the 100 days of SwiftUI course, posted in Paul Hudson's Hacking With Swift website. The app features a simple tip splitter
that retrieves a bill amount, then returns the amount that should be paid per person after adding the tip (tip amount can be selected using a segmented
picker) then splitting it between the desired amount of persons (using a standard picker)
